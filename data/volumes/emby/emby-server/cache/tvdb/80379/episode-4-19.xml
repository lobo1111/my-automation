  <Overview>Sheldon's World of Warcraft online game account is hacked and he is determined to find out who did it. Also Penny shares some girl talk with her friends about Leonard and his new girlfriend. When Howard discovers who hacked the account, the guys depart for a quest to Carlsbad, California where the hacker, Todd Zarnecki, lives in order to retrieve the stolen account, along with "enchanted weapons, gladiator armor, gold, and a battle ostrich, Glenn". Despite Sheldon carrying his Bat'leth with him they fail miserably. On the way back their car engine breaks down, and they're saved by Penny, who came to drive them home and upon hearing about their failure promises to show them "How we finish quests in Nebraska" and forces Zarnecki to give up kicking him below waist.</Overview>
