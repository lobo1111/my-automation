  <Overview>Seismic waves shake Griffin Rock, but they are artificial and caused by a reverberating loudspeaker hidden underground. Such loudspeaker is inadvertently connected remotely to Doc Greene's jukebox, where Doc Greene is practicing his dance moves. Meanwhile, Frankie creates a music video that includes footage of the Rescue Bots. Suspicious, she follows them into an underground tunnel during their mission to remove the loudspeaker inside, and attempts to converse with Heatwave. When the rocks are falling from the tunnel ceiling, Heatwave breaks from his "robot" character to save her, during which she finally learns of the Rescue Bot's secret. </Overview>
