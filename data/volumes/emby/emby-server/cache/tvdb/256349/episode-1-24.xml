  <Overview>Doc Greene invents a repulsor badge that allows the wearer to be occluded from projectiles. Cody uses it to participate more on the front lines, in missions with the rest of his family, against Chief Burns concern of his safety. His superhero status, however, is halted when his repulsor badge is overloaded and projects a nonstop field, enclosing him inside. Boulder uses neutralizing gloves, also invented by Doc Greene, to bypass the repulsive field and successfully remove the badge from Cody, shortly before it detonates. </Overview>
